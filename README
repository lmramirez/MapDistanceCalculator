This is a program I wrote in R to calculate relative distances on a map. For example sometimes I'm planning out a bike ride and have a picture of a map and I want to be able to calculate distances anywhere on the map not jsut the streets like say google maps could. On here, I could just match up the distances with the legend on the map and calculate any distances I want on that map.
